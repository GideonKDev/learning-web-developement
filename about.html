<h1>ABOUT OUR COMPANY</h1>
<body><div>
    <p>Blur (stylized as blur) is a 2010 arcade-style racing video game for Microsoft Windows, 
        PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. It was developed by Bizarre Creations and published by Activision. 
        Blur features a racing style that incorporates real world cars and locales with arcade style 
        handling and vehicular combat.</p>
    <p>The gameplay in Blur is centered on vehicular combat. The game tracks present eight different 
        powerups that the cars can pick up. Each car can carry a maximum of three powerups at any given time, 
        that they can then switch and activate at will, or discard.</p>
    <p>Out of the eight powerups, five of them are weapons, with the remaining ones being a defensive shield,
         a repair wrench that restores any damage that the car may have sustained, and a nitrous boost. Several of the weapons
         ' behavior can be modified to select whether the player wants them to fire forwards or backwards, and most of them can also 
         be used defensively against attacks from other cars.</p>
